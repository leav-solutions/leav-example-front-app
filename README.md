# LEAV Engine example custom app

This template provides a minimal setup to make a custom app for the LEAV Engine. It embeds Typescript, React, Apollo Client, Aristid's design system, translation with react-i18next, linting...

It's based on the Vite React/Typescript template.

To get started, clone this repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the VITE_BUILD_OUT_DIR variable.

Then run `npm build` to build this app to the appropriate directory in LEAV Engine.

Once the build is done, go to LEAV Engine and create a new app based on this module to see it in action.

Enjoy!
